Data cleaning and ML algorithms on Olympic data!


This was mock data used from the Olympics team. I was able to do a lot of data cleaning and run machine learning algorithms to see if being injury prone was real or not.

There are plenty of factors and variables to look at when determining if injury proneness is real or not.

I would love to dive even deeper into this data and possibly compare sports and other variables and run ML algorithms on those, as well.
